# Pocom: Principles of Compiler Construction Algorithms

A collection of compiler construction algorithms and implementations, designed for educational purposes and practical experimentation with compiler theory.

## Overview

Pocom (short for "Principles of Compiler Construction") is a repository dedicated to implementing core compiler algorithms. This project aims to provide clear, well-documented examples of fundamental compiler components, making it easier to understand the inner workings of compilers.

## Features

- **Lexical Analysis**: Implementation of tokenizers and scanners
- **Syntax Analysis**: Recursive descent and LR parsers
- **Semantic Analysis**: Type checking and symbol table management
- **Intermediate Code Generation**: Three-address code implementation
- **Code Optimization**: Basic optimization techniques
- **Target Code Generation**: Simple code generation for stack-based virtual machine
